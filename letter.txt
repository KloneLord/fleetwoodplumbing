Hi Jessie,

Thank you for sending through the catalogues – I’ve had a chance to look at them, and I’m very interested in exploring a partnership with your company.

Before moving forward, I’d like to confirm a few details to ensure the products meet Australian standards and my business requirements:

Materials and Safety:
What materials are the products made from? Are they body-safe and free from harmful chemicals like phthalates, BPA, or heavy metals?  Do you have certifications like REACH (EU compliance) or other material safety reports?

Testing and Quality:
Have your products been tested by independent labs? If so, can you share test reports for product safety?

Custom Branding and Packaging:
Do you offer custom branding (logos, packaging, etc.) for bulk orders?
Can you provide discreet packaging options for my customers?

Electrical Products (if applicable):
For items with batteries or chargers, do they meet safety standards like the CE certification?

Australian Compliance:
Are there any known restrictions for importing these products into Australia?

Samples:
Could you provide samples for inspection before placing a larger order?

I’m keen to build a strong and reliable business relationship, so ensuring product safety, quality, and compliance is very important for me.

Looking forward to hearing back from you!
